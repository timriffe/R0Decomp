  abstract = {Total fertility rates fell to previously unseen levels in a large
	number of countries beginning in the early 1990s. The persistence
	of TFRs below 1.3 raised the possibility of rapid population aging
	and decline. We discuss the recent widespread turnaround in so-called
	lowest-low-fertility countries in Europe and East Asia. The number
	of countries with TFRs below 1.3 fell from 21 in 2003 to five in
	2008. Moreover, the upturn in the TFR was not confined to lowest-fertility
	countries, but affected the whole developed world. We explore the
	demographic explanations for the recent rise in TFRs stemming from
	fertility timing effects as well as economic, policy, and social
	factors. Although the current economic downturn may suppress TFRs
	in the short run, we conclude that formerly lowest-low-fertility
	countries will continue to see increases in fertility as the transitory
	effects of shifts to later childbearing become less important. Copyright

	Examples include decomposition of the change over time in the average

	crude death rate in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands is also
